Hello! I'm Matt, but most people call me Lumen! (full name: Lumenascent)
I'm the creator and owner of the NFT collection 'lhcnftsonwax'! I am the primary developer of the project, and I recently teamed up with Flid from FrenchMonetGang to get his help creating our new Discord bot, Lightkeeper! This is the Lightpaper for the collection! I've added it to Github to try and keep a record of all changes made to the Lightpaper going forward, that way people can see for themselves what has changed when it's updated!
