LHC stands for Lighthouse Crypto, and it is a collective of people (based on Discord) that love cryptocurrency, NFTs, and everything else crypto related! To clarify, LHC, (or Lighthouse Crypto) and LNOW, (or lighthousenftsonwax), have two separate discords  LHC is a collective, LNOW is an NFT project created by Lumenascent, the founder of LHC.  
The discord for LNOW can be found here: https://discord.gg/wveCtwkVdx 
The goal of LHC is to be a metaphorical lighthouse for those who need it in these rough and crazy waves of crypto, and to always be a light to others! We believe wholeheartedly in the idea that we all can succeed together, as long as we work together and lift each other up! We want to raise up those who share these same values and ideals, and hope that they will do the same for the rest of the community as well! I want to do my best to make sure that the LNOW collection embodies these values as well, and will strive to make sure that it continues to! WAX Back Rewards, special airdrops, VIP Tokens, and more, are planned to try my very best to make LNOW not only full of wonderful and interesting artwork, but to also promote and maintain great value for the project as well! In addition to lifting each other up, LHC and LNOW also believes very strongly in transparency. This means that we will always do our best to be as open and honest about all things related to LHC, LNOW, and otherwise. On-chain transactions are always publicly recorded and available, and holders are encouraged to check on the wallets related to the collection on wax.bloks.io or another WAX chain explorer! If anyone ever has any questions, concerns, feels like something is strange to them, or anything else in regards to LNOW or it's direction, please reach out to Lumenascent!
The project is constantly changing and evolving, but the one thing that will never change is the focus on scarcity, value, transparency, and most importantly, making sure holders also feel their NFTs are valuable.
