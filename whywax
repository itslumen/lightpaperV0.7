I decided to use WAX to create the LHC NFT collection due to the ease-of-use of the WAX chain, carbon-neutral minting (this is huge!), fee-free and near-instant transactions, as well as a seriously great community surrounding WAX! The ability to mint on WAX is also seriously easy, which adds to the many list of reasons! I feel like WAX has some of the most innovative projects in the NFT space at the moment, especially when it comes to music and gaming, and that this will only continue to grow! I also believe that WAX has amazing growth potential itself as a coin, so getting in on it early will always be more beneficial!
